Hey there, I'm glad you're here! :tada:

This blog is intended as a place for me to publish everything I like to think about and work on in my free time. In a form that could be enriching to others stumbling over it as well. Because keeping track of the progress in my different ongoing projects that way, makes every bigger stride more valuable. And allows me to share more of my doings even before they're finished.

So you can just scroll through the different posts and open up what teases you or click on the featured tags to filter it down to one topic. Do as you like and enjoy yourself as I most certainly do. :blush:
