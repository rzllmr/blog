When you enter your local music store and proclaim that you want to buy an acoustic guitar, an assistant probably hands you their best selling one that fits your price range. But when you ask maybe just the same person (that happens to be a passionate expert) to unfold the world of guitars for you, so can make up your own mind, you let yourself in for a lot. They will tell you about the sizes, shapes, tone woods, features, brands and all their different combinations. Adding up to thousands of possibilities to juggle in your head.

With this post I want to contribute to making some sense of it all.

## Shapes and sizes

## Tone woods

But for now you read enough of my lines already to end it here. I'll leave you be with the rest of a delightful day and hope this post could add something to it. :blush:
