When you enter your local music store and proclaim that you want to buy an acoustic guitar, an assistant probably hands you their best selling one that fits your price range. But when you ask maybe just the same person (that happens to be a passionate expert) to unfold the world of guitars, so you can make up your own mind, you let yourself in for a lot. They will tell you about the sizes, shapes, tone woods, features, brands and all their different combinations. Adding up to thousands of possibilities to juggle in your head.

With this post I want to contribute to making some sense of it all.

## Shapes and sizes

You see that let alone in size and shape there is a lot of variety. But why is that? What are all those for?

One simple reason is mere volume. Because of the bigger resonating body ones like the Dreadnaught or Jumbo are especially loud in comparison. And they needed to be in times where they were used without much amplification and competing for a place within a band. The name of the orchestra model still speaks to that. But as many come with an optional pickup[^pickup] today, that's not that important anymore. 

The sound is vital though and it is very affected by the various bodies used as well. Every feature makes a difference: the width, depth, contour, coves. With the general tendency that smaller sizes pronounce the mids and bigger sizes the low/bass and high/treble end of the sound spectrum. You want a full rounded sound? Take a Grand Auditorium with little depth. And why shouldn't you want a full rounded sound? Because you may need a Parlour that shines through among other instruments. Or a Dreadnaught that leaves enough room for your voice to be heard.

And another aspect to consider certainly is comfort. When you spend much of your time with a guitar on your lap or strapped to your shoulder it should feel pleasant. Not to small, not too big and with a neck that's easy for you to hold and play.

## Tone woods

Let's say you found the size and shape that suits you best. Then it's likely that there are still variants of that guitar with different used woods.

If you still can't decide after all this considerations. Take the one that you like to look at. :wink:
