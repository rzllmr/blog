Hi, ich bin Rob.

I'm a professional software engineer with substantial experience in many languages, technologies and design principles. Most recently revolving around the Web world of TypeScript, Web Apps and Electron.

I studied physics to understand the inanimate part of nature and learned a lot about a scientific approach to questions big and small.

I play guitar and write music since my teenager years, but always less than I would like to have done.

Because I first and foremost love to venture out to new domains and little niches one can crawl into.
